# 4/6/2020 Update

For this week we were meant to implement the KV Store in a distributed fashion that way it can run across our network in order to support a word-count application. Our implementation is not fully functional but it should be working soon. We continue to run into issues for pair programming as now we are in different time zones, so coordinating our work schedules is difficult. We still have outstanding issues lingering, so those must be addressed before we can fully get Milestone 4 functional. We hope to resolve our outstanding issues early this week to help us prepare to deliver the final Milestone. One issue that we have been constantly facing and forced to fix are issues with serialization and circular dependencies. We believe that our serialization is functional now, but debugging that along with circular dependencies has caused many issues for us and slowed down development greatly. Hopefully we are able to fix our issues from previous weeks as well as our time zone differences to finish the final project for the deadline.

Resolved issues
- Serialization
- Circular dependencies

Unresolved issues
- Debugging of KV Store
- Interconnecting KV with higher level word-count application

Going forwards, we plan on finishing our lingering issues when it comes to Milestone 3 and 4. We still have a lot of issues connecting our network together to properly run the KV store on each individual instance, but we feel as though we should be able to finish this by next week.
