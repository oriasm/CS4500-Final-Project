# 4/13/2020 Update

This week was full implementation of the project. We still had some lingering issues to resolve and were unable to get it all to work. Despite this, we were still able to make some progress this week. What we mostly fixed up was our continuous errors with circular dependencies as well as past bug fixes that continued to nag us. Additionally, in order to promote readability we reformatted some of our code as well as added additional comments and annotations. We still have experienced some issues in regard to pair programming as we are currently on other sides of the country which is why we have not been able to progress as much as we would have liked. Despite all of this, we believe that we put in a good effort in trying to get what we have functional despite these non-ideal circumstances.

Unresolved issues
- Full implementation

Going forwards, there is not much we can do as the class is over. We look forward to reviewing everything in our final code walk.
